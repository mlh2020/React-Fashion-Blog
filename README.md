# React + Vite

## Fashion Blog Application Demo

This project serves as a demonstration of a fashion blog application, specifically developed for a software engineering cohort. The exercise encompasses several key phases in web development:

1. **Initial Development:** Building the initial version of the site using plain HTML.

2. **React Implementation:** Reconstructing the site using React to enhance its functionality and user interaction.

3. **Deployment:** Finally, deploying the application to Netlify to make it publicly accessible and showcase the integration of modern deployment practices.

This step-by-step approach not only reflects the evolution of the project but also provides practical experience in various aspects of web development, from basic HTML structuring to advanced React techniques and deployment strategies.
